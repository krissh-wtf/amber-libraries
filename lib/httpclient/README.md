# httpclient

a POSIX-compliant http client library for bash/[amber](https://amber-lang.org) without using external dependencies


## info
while the generated bash in amber is POSIX-compliant it often does not use the "preferred" methods, this is due to the language not being finished yet it'll likely be completely compliant when it is out of alpha.
